    "# Retrieval Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides *some* intuition, along with run-able code (so long as the enviorment is set up according to **Usage** in [README.md](../README.md)) regarding how (and to what extect) the use of transformer-based ontology-aware embedding methods (specifically, Hierarchy Transformers REF and Ontology Transformers REF) affect knowledge retrieval performance, focusing on effectiveness rather than efficiency. Effectiveness is taken to mean: 'does your system find good results' REF, where as efficency concerns itself with how fast it finds them. When discussing effectiveness, we consider the specific tasks, as outlined within §3.1.1 of the associated paper (thesis submission). Summarily, we consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single Target Knowledge Retrieval: This can be thought of as a form of *entity linking*. Specifically, the linkage should *loosly satisfy (approximate)* the the equivlance relation $e_{id} \\equiv C \\quad | \\quad C \\in N_C$, where $e_{id}$ is denoted the identified entity (for an arbitrary string), and $C$ is some concept in $N_C$ (the set of named classes) drawn from an ontology $\\mathcal{O}$ (SNOMED CT). Alternatively, a valid *approximation* may also satisfy the subclass *(or subsumption, under inference)* relation $e_{id} \\sqsubseteq C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multiple Target Knowledge Retrieval: Extends single target knowledge retrieval by specifying that $e_{id} \\sqsubseteq C^\\star$ should hold, where $C^\\star* is the reflective ancestor set of $C$ (essentially, any valid concept/class that holds under subsumption).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to evaluate effectivenss, we test agaisnt both **lexical** and **contextual** baselines, where TF--IDF and BM25 are used for lexical baselines and SBERT (MiniLM-L12-v2) is used for a contextual baselines; and we primarily use MRR for single target; whereas mAP and nDCG are both used for multiple target retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarily, we aim to *(..answer the research questions outlined in the thesis; but, ultimately:)* evaluate **whether the Ontology Transformer** framework (which builds on the Hierarchy Transformer) **is better than the** associated **strong contextual baseline** methods **on** the above-mentioned **knowledge retrieval tasks**, **for effective retrieval** (as measured using evaluation **metrics** that **preferentially weight early matches**, and provide some indication of ordering relevance for multi-target retrieval).\n",
    "\n",
    "The research questions (RQ1, RQ2, RQ4, RQ5) are essentially captured and in-part discussed throughout this notebook. In this notebook we:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Provide some mathematical intuition (drwaing on both HiT REF and OnT REF for hyperbolic space and embeddings; then from the 'learning mixed curvature representations' paper for mixed models REF).\n",
    "2. Describe the framework which supports our experimental evaluation (including data management and the retriever framework).\n",
    "3. Outline the intuition behind nDCG and include implementations for all evaluation metrics.\n",
    "4. Briefly discuss embedding and retrieval; and provide the neccesary code snippets for re-use.\n",
    "5. Provide full implementations used in obtaining our experimental results.\n",
    "6. Discuss **and test** *(in some detail)* the assumptions that underlay *(and justify)* our choice of ablation studies, i.e. the use of miniature models (the effects of ontology size on HiT/OnT training), and the performance of cross-domain encoders in regards to ANATOMY, specifically.\n",
    "\n",
    "## TL;DR\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is provided to show the results of the experiments, but also, to provide a *step by step* means by which to work through the code. First imports are provided (which can be largely ignored), then utility and math functions are outlined; encoding/producing embeddings (saving + loading) is demonstrated, retrievers are implemented and experiments are conducted: single-target knowledge retrieval, multiple target knowledge retrieval and assumption testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Quick Note on $\\leftarrow$\n",
    "\n",
    "Just a quick word on reading $\\leftarrow$, typically thought of as assignment; in these notes, it is meant to be read *drawn from*, not dissimilar to, e.g. `elem c [N_C | N_C <- O]`, where `elem :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Bool`."

    "As this work is fundamentally based on the Hierarchy Transformer (HiT) and Ontology Transformer (OnT), we note that both are based on mapping the output space of a modified SBERT encoder (where the result of the output embeddings, i.e. `tanh : H_{state} -> output`, is bound to `[-1,1]`--a hypercube) is circumscribed by a poincare ball (think of this as a cube encapsulated within a sphere); and since the space within a poincare ball operates according to hyperbolic geometry (since, it is hyperbolic space; by definition), then we can picture this as a kind of 'warped curved space' constrained to a *(hyper)* sphere, situated within a larger euclidean space.\n",

    "\n",
    "Within the poincare ball we model relationships such that the curvature associated with distance (or, geodesics) between any two points $u,v$ in $B^n$ (this representation) grows increaing larger the further they are situated from the origin (nearer to the circumfrance). Thus, distances that would ordinarily be 'quite far' in $\\mathbb{R}$ are much larger in $\\mathbb{H}$ for pairs of points situated further from the origin *(grows exponentially as you move towards the circumfrance of the ball, as you're approaching $\\infty$)*; so, the idea behind the encoder's use of hyperbolic clustering loss and centripetal loss is to: 1. cluster similar concepts together, but also push more *fine-grained* concepts towards the boundaries; so that if we want to provide a score for how likely some concept C is subsumed by D (and given that they're ordered hierarchically relative to the origin), then we want to find two concepts that are near to one another, but we also we want to offset the depth so that the score function preferentially weights concepts with a hierarchical pre-order within the space. This is essentially what is happening with the subsumption score function, as provided below: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "score(u, v) = - \\big(d_\\kappa(\\boldsymbol{x}_{u}, \\boldsymbol{x}_v) + \\lambda (\\|\\boldsymbol{x}_{v}\\|_{\\kappa} - \\| \\boldsymbol{x}_{u}\\|_{\\kappa})\\big),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the *depth-agnostic* distance term $d_\\kappa(\\boldsymbol{x}_{u}, \\boldsymbol{x}_v)$ scores pairs of points (embeddings) that are close to one another higher, then this is offset by the *'depth bias'* (centripetal weight) $\\lambda (\\|\\boldsymbol{x}_{v}\\|_{\\kappa} - \\| \\boldsymbol{x}_{u}\\|_{\\kappa})$, where any candidate parents are judged to more likely subsume the child if they are situated closer to the origin than the child candidate *(due to the hierarchical pre-order)*.\n"

    "The way in which data is managed takes _*<u>some</u>*_ inspiration from the notion of an **object relational mapping** (ORM). \n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of queries as instances of data (objects, with an associated **query string** and **target set**), whose targets relate to one another through subsumption and equivalance (at minimum). Additionally, since we want to use these queries as input to our experiments, we define their shape at the data-level *(see the provided JSON files; no schema, sorry!)*, and then wrap that shape within a model (a class) that can be instanciated with a specific instance of datum. Furthermore, we can equip the model with a set of methods, allowing us to mutate the data after it has been load *(a data model, essentially)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**That is, each query:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* has an associated 'query string' $q_s$ and a target class $C$.\n",
    "* Is an instance of subsumption query or equivelance query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where, a subsumption query has a target set of classes $C^\\star$, where any valid antescendant of the original target class is considered a relevant target (with associated *'in-built'* methods for calculating relevance, etc.); and similar is the case with an equivelance query *(though, we don't focus too much on these)*.\n",

Thus, we use retrievers as a convienent wrapper to drive retrieval of relevant concepts from the embedding store. For lexical retrievers, they either simply store the textual representations/verbalisations in memory, or save an inverted index to disk to re-use later; and of course, the retrievers are also responsible for keeping track of the mapping: $verbalisation \\leftrightarrow embedding$.\n",

    "It might be noted that, while the model is learning/re-training, its performance at mapping NF2-NF4 (see the H1 scores) is still much to be desired. There is quite a bit of room for improvement with respect to prediction tasks when compared to the results presented within the original OnT paper. We might note that the H1 score for NF1 is aligned with the expected performance, though this does not seem to be the case for the remaining scores. Several factors could be influencing the model, including (but not limited to) the number of epochs (set to one), the batch size/learning rate, representative class balance (and the sheer size of the ontology -- SNOMED~CT is extremely large, with >= 300k stated axioms, and >= 700k verbalisations when EL-normalised).\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, SNOMED~CT is significantly larger and more complex than ANATOMY (uberon), Gene Ontology (GO) and GALEN; and so, our working theory, understanding or **assumption** is that adopting a smaller ontology with a potentially more balanced set of representative normal forms (NF1 $\\rightarrow$ NF4) may help to improve the training process. Additionally, we **assume** that the conceptual domain overlap between SNOMED CT and Uberon/ANATOMY is significant. This would explain the performance delta between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following from our assumptions above, we perform multiple tests which include training miniature models (with varying batch size) and comparing performance between cross-domain queries; i.e. anatomical queries, taken to be the set of axioms that relate to body structure and morphalogical abnormality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our aims, in this instance, are to:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Test whether we can effectively leverage a subset of the original data (a smaller ontology) during model training, such that any experimental results obtained during downstream retrieval can aid in supporting our assumption about ontology size.\n",
    "2. Test the performance of ANATOMY (along with domain-tuned models) on subsets of the original evaluation data to test whether ANATOMY does, in fact, perform better on anatomical queries; and to what degree this difference is apparent.\n",
    "3. Aim to Capture enough of the SNOMED CT ontology during during miniature model training such that the performance can generalise **well-enough** to the retrieval tasks on our evaluation data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**We accomplish this by:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <u>Training miniature models</u> (with batch sizes: 32, 64, 128) on a subset of SNOMED~CT (with only 36,420 subclass axioms and 13,680 equivalent classes) containing the following concept branches:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Body Structure\n",
    "* Clinical Finding\n",
    "* Event\n",
    "* Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we review the models performance on the validation set *(generated using ELNormalise)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <u>Dividing our evaluation queries into ANATOMY-related and ANATOMY-unrelated subsets</u>, and then re-running the original experiments agaianst each constituent subset, allowing us to identify whether (and to what degree) our assumption about domain-overlap hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We find that:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, **yes, the ontology size appears to effect model performance.** Specifically, much larger and more complex ontologies are more challanging for the model to learn effective mappings; and that, **there does appear to be domain overlap between SNOMED CT and ANATOMY**, helping to support both of our assumptions in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experimental implementations and results are provided below."

He has not had a fever, cough, vomiting, or diarrhea. He has asthma and eczema. He uses a glucocorticoid inhaler and an albuterol inhaler but has missed his medications for the past week while on vacation. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 100/80. Expiratory and inspiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. There are moderate intercostal and subcostal retractions and a decreased inspiratory to expiratory ratio. Nebulized albuterol and ipratropium treatments and intravenous methylprednisolone are given in the emergency department for a presumed asthma exacerbation. One hour later, the child is limp and lethargic. Magnesium sulfate is administered. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 150/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 100/70. No wheezing is heard on repeat pulmonary examination. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n",

Past medical history is significant for gastroesophageal reflux disease, and recent appendicitis, status post laparoscopic appendectomy complicated by delirium tremens. His vitals are a temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg, pulse of 78/min, and respiratory rate of 12/min. Physical examination reveals a distended abdomen with shifting dullness on percussion. In addition, multiple purple spider web-like lesions are present on the chest and arms, which blanch when pressure is applied. Fecal occult blood test is negative. On anoscopy, a non-tender, dilated vascular protrusion is noted superior to the pectinate line. Which of the following is most likely true about this patient’s current symptoms?\",\n",
