    "question": "A 34-year-old man with acute lymphocytic leukemia presents for follow-up in the oncology clinic after his second cycle of chemotherapy. In addition to intermittent nausea, he has mild weakness, tingling, and numbness in his left hand. With his affected hand, he is able to grip, but occasionally drops small objects. His oncologist tells him that one of his chemotherapy agents likely caused his neuropathy given its strong association with neurotoxicity. He was recently treated with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, and dasatinib. The culprit medication works by which of the following mechanisms of action?",

This equiv class defines a more accurate target axiom for the entity mention when the entity mention is taken in isolation. However, in the context of being related to the gallbladder (which they are), a potentially more accurate target entity would be 'gallbladder and bile duct calculi', this may actually point to aspects of SNOMED CT that are lacking. Furthermore, if one were to define a **new** axiom for 'bile duct stone' or 'bile duct stones' as a clinical finding: ''Clinical Finding (finding)' and ('Role group (attribute)' some  (('Associated morphology (attribute)' some 'Calculus (morphologic abnormality)') and ('Finding site (attribute)' some 'Bile duct structure (body structure)'))) with an associated verbalisation: 'clinical finding and role group something that some associated morphology some calculus and finding site some bile duct structure', we would see OnTr vastly outperforming other embedding models (even though the axiom does not currently exist within SNOMED CT).",

Examination shows scleral icterus and jaundice. There are several telangiectasias over the chest and back. Palmar erythema is present. The abdomen is mildly distended and nontender. Shifting dullness is present. There is a flapping tremor of both hands when outstretched and dorsiflexed. Neurologic examination shows no other focal findings.

The mother mentions that her boy is always tired, and seems to be getting worse. He prefers watching television rather than going out and playing with other kids. Furthermore, he has had frequent episodes of constipation since birth. Except for frequent cravings for salty foods, the boy eats a regular diet. The patient was delivered healthy and is fully immunized. The medical history is unremarkable, and he takes no medications. He has no siblings. His father is a banker and his mother is a librarian. The pulse is 90/min, the blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 15/min. He is in the bottom 10th percentile for height and weight according to his age. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. He recently had a urinalysis that showed elevated urinary calcium excretion.\nAdditional lab testing results are as follows:\nSerum electrolytes\nSodium 135 mEq/L\nPotassium 3.2 mEq/L\nChloride 95 mEq/L\nPlasma renin activity 10 ng/mL/hr (normal, 0.5–3.3 ng/mL/hr)\nPlasma aldosterone concentration 20 ng/dL (normal, 2–9 ng/dL)\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?",

Nebulized albuterol and ipratropium treatments and intravenous methylprednisolone are given in the emergency department for a presumed asthma exacerbation. One hour later, the child is limp and lethargic. Magnesium sulfate is administered. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 150/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 100/70.

Pulse oximetry on 100% oxygen via nasal cannula shows an oxygen saturation of 92%. Auscultation of the lungs discloses decreased breath sounds at the bases with expiratory crackles bilaterally. Cardiac examination discloses an irregularly irregular rhythm, an indistinct point of maximal impulse, and a loud S1.
