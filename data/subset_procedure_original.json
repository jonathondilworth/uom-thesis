    "question": "A 56-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband because of increasing confusion, generalized fatigue, and irritability for the past week. She has been unable to recall her husband's name or their address. She has had insomnia and daytime sleepiness during this period. Her last bowel movement was 3 days ago. One month ago, she underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portal shunt (TIPS) placement. She has alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Current medications include spironolactone and furosemide. She used to drink over a pint of vodka daily but quit 2 months ago. She is oriented to place and person. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 102/64 mm Hg. Examination shows scleral icterus and jaundice. There are several telangiectasias over the chest and back. Palmar erythema is present. The abdomen is mildly distended and nontender. Shifting dullness is present. There is a flapping tremor of both hands when outstretched and dorsiflexed. Neurologic examination shows no other focal findings. She completes the number connection test slower than the age-normalized standard. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "question": "A 9-year-old boy is brought to a physician by his mother for evaluation of generalized weakness, increased urination, and increased thirst. The mother mentions that her boy is always tired, and seems to be getting worse. He prefers watching television rather than going out and playing with other kids. Furthermore, he has had frequent episodes of constipation since birth. Except for frequent cravings for salty foods, the boy eats a regular diet. The patient was delivered healthy and is fully immunized. The medical history is unremarkable, and he takes no medications. He has no siblings. His father is a banker and his mother is a librarian. The pulse is 90/min, the blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 15/min. He is in the bottom 10th percentile for height and weight according to his age. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. He recently had a urinalysis that showed elevated urinary calcium excretion.\nAdditional lab testing results are as follows:\nSerum electrolytes\nSodium 135 mEq/L\nPotassium 3.2 mEq/L\nChloride 95 mEq/L\nPlasma renin activity 10 ng/mL/hr (normal, 0.5–3.3 ng/mL/hr)\nPlasma aldosterone concentration 20 ng/dL (normal, 2–9 ng/dL)\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?",
