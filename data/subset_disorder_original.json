    "question": "A 34-year-old man with acute lymphocytic leukemia presents for follow-up in the oncology clinic after his second cycle of chemotherapy. In addition to intermittent nausea, he has mild weakness, tingling, and numbness in his left hand. With his affected hand, he is able to grip, but occasionally drops small objects. His oncologist tells him that one of his chemotherapy agents likely caused his neuropathy given its strong association with neurotoxicity. He was recently treated with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, and dasatinib. The culprit medication works by which of the following mechanisms of action?",

This equiv class defines a more accurate target axiom for the entity mention when the entity mention is taken in isolation. However, in the context of being related to the gallbladder (which they are), a potentially more accurate target entity would be 'gallbladder and bile duct calculi', this may actually point to aspects of SNOMED CT that are lacking. Furthermore, if one were to define a **new** axiom for 'bile duct stone' or 'bile duct stones' as a clinical finding: ''Clinical Finding (finding)' and ('Role group (attribute)' some  (('Associated morphology (attribute)' some 'Calculus (morphologic abnormality)') and ('Finding site (attribute)' some 'Bile duct structure (body structure)'))) with an associated verbalisation: 'clinical finding and role group something that some associated morphology some calculus and finding site some bile duct structure', we would see OnTr vastly outperforming other embedding models (even though the axiom does not currently exist within SNOMED CT).",

    "question": "A 62-year-old man presents with bright red blood in his stool which occurred 2 times this week. He denies fever, weight loss, pain, pruritus or urinary symptoms. Past medical history is significant for gastroesophageal reflux disease, and recent appendicitis, status post laparoscopic appendectomy complicated by delirium tremens. His vitals are a temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg, pulse of 78/min, and respiratory rate of 12/min. Physical examination reveals a distended abdomen with shifting dullness on percussion. In addition, multiple purple spider web-like lesions are present on the chest and arms, which blanch when pressure is applied. Fecal occult blood test is negative. On anoscopy, a non-tender, dilated vascular protrusion is noted superior to the pectinate line. Which of the following is most likely true about this patient’s current symptoms?",

    "question": "A 34-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department following a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which she was the restrained driver. On arrival, she has a cervical collar in place and is unresponsive. Her temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 131/76 mm Hg. Her pupils are dilated and not reactive to light. She is unresponsive to noxious stimuli. She is intubated, and mechanical ventilation is begun. Serum concentrations of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, and creatinine are within the reference range. Toxicology screening is negative. A CT scan of the head without contrast shows a massive intracranial bleed and a cervical spine injury at the level of C3. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing brain death?",
